# Specification Quality Checklist: Brand CRUD

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Scope deliberately excludes brand kit status display, provider keys, and generations —
  those resource types don't exist in the data model until later phases; this phase
  covers brand creation, viewing, logo management, and deletion only.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed: brand-name uniqueness scope, deletion
  confirmation UX (type-to-confirm), and non-owner access opacity all have clear
  precedent either directly in `docs/implementation-plan.md` or in the existing
  001-user-auth-profile feature's established security posture (never reveal whether a
  resource exists to a non-owner).
